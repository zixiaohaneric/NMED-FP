                    The early exploration stage of Chinese animation can be traced back to the early 20th century, when
                    the animation industry was almost blank in China. However, with their love and exploratory spirit
                    for animation art, their predecessors embarked on a difficult path of exploration.
                    <br>
                    In terms of technology, early Chinese animation mainly relied on traditional hand drawn techniques.
                    Artists need to draw frames by frames, and the birth of each animated work requires a lot of
                    manpower and time. For example, in 1926, the Wan brothers produced China's first animated film, "Da
                    Nao Studio," which was completed by hand under rudimentary conditions. Subsequently, over the course
                    of several decades, hand drawn techniques have continuously developed and improved, from simple line
                    outlines to gradually enriched color applications, accumulating valuable production experience for
                    Chinese animation.
                    <br>
                    The creative experience, technical accumulation, and audience base accumulated by these early
                    classic anime works provided strong support for the explosive development of the Chinese anime
                    industry around 2010, becoming an indispensable and important stage in the development of Chinese
                    anime.

            <div class="text">
                Around 2010, China's domestic animation industry experienced explosive growth, driven by various
                factors to reach new heights.
                <br>
                In terms of production technology, traditional hand drawing is gradually transitioning towards
                digitalization. Animation production companies have begun to introduce advanced digital drawing
                software, 3D modeling, and animation production tools, which have greatly improved production
                efficiency and image quality. For example, in the past, drawing a complex frame of image may have
                required the artist to spend hours or even days. After digitization, with the convenience of drawing
                software, the drawing time has been greatly reduced, and the lines of the image are smoother and the
                colors are more accurate. In the production of "Nano Core", 3D modeling technology is extensively
                used to create realistic sci-fi scenes and character images. The mecha settings are finely crafted
                to every texture, giving the audience a strong visual impact and marking a new level of visual
                presentation in domestic animation.

                        online and offline communication, promoting the spread of detective culture among young people,
                        and inspiring the creation of some detective themed anime in China.
