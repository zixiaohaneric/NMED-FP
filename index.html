                Around 2010, Chinese society is in a critical period of rapid popularization of the Internet. The rapid
                coverage of broadband networks and the initial rise of mobile Internet have provided unprecedented
                convenient channels for the spread of anime culture. Various animation websites and game forums have
                sprung up like mushrooms, allowing anime fans scattered around the country to easily gather, share
                resources and exchange ideas.
                <br>
                At the same time, the country has begun to attach importance to the development of cultural industries
                and has introduced a series of policies to support cultural and creative industries such as animation
                and games. This has not only stimulated the enthusiasm of domestic creators, spawned a number of
                excellent local works, but also attracted the introduction of high-quality anime content from abroad. In
                such an environment, the anime culture gradually gets rid of the limitations of the small circle, moves
                from the early private communication among friends to a broader public vision, and begins to have an
                impact on the youth group and even the broader social level, quietly opening a new chapter of the
                vigorous development of China's anime culture.
